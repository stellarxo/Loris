1. Create a new candidate and create new timepoint for them.
2. Click "Start Visit Stage" on left of instrument_list ensure that page
   renders.
3. Ensure that stage can only be started with the data_entry permission
   and for candidates at the user's site.
4. Ensure that you get an error if dates do not match.
5. Ensure that you get an error if scan_done missing
6. Create a timepoint where the age (date entered minus DoB) falls within the
   AgeMin and AgeMax for a test_battery. Ensure that those instruments are
   inserted (for the correct subprojectID).
7. Create a timepoint where there is a test_battery entry for the
   Visit_label and start the stage. Ensure that those were inserted into
   the battery, and NOT the ones based on age.
8. Ensure that any instruments in test_battery with firstVisit='Y' where
   inserted if and only if it's the first timepoint started. Ensure that
   firstVisit='N' instruments are inserted if and only if it is NOT the
   first timepoint started, and firstVisit=null whether or not it's the
   first time point.
9. Ensure that if a CenterID is set for a row in the test battery, the
   instrument is inserted for candidates at that centerID (if Visit_label
   or Age are correct.), and not other centers.
10. Ensure that if Active='N' for an instrument in the test_battery it is
    NOT inserted even if other criteria pass.
